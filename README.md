# About
This is the analysis/code part my mid-term project.

It's going to be a scientific paper on what Google Play store, Free, English app genres are "most-profitable". [^1] One more thing, I have no clue how to properly do data science, this will be first solo project and I will make many mistakes and/or innacurate judgements on how I should go about things.

This is just a massively increased scale of the [Dataquest project guide](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-data-science-portfolio-project-tutorial/), using data from [Gautham Prakash's 2.3 million Google play store app dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps)

### Footnotes

[^1]: This will in no way be a professional or formal project, I have no clue why my school decided to torture us like this, but I'll just use this opportunity to expand my portfolio

[^2]: The reason there are so many .csv files in the *src* folder, is because they are used as a time save. Why re-clean csv files over and over again, when I can just save a cleaned one and assign it to a new variable.
